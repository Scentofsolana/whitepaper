## Vision and mission

Wonder how Solana smells? This project will fly you to the scent universe of Solana blockchain. Our goal is to mix in the millions of NFT and provide a special Scent in your wallet. Scent of Solana is unique and a must have NFT for everyone, especially for those who already have an NFT collection in their wallet. In this case, the bottle of scent will let your collection reborn with a new smell. Works perfectly with all NFT‚Äôs. Scent of solana provides not just the NFT, but a Litemeta of additional platforms to get users to earn <mark style="color:blue;">**SPRING**</mark> tokens, discover unique Scents and get into the adventure.
