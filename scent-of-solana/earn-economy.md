# üêº Earn economy!

Scent economy is based on NFT ERA1 (genesis) holdings. Each holder will be airdropped with two NFT's - <mark style="color:green;">LaNd</mark> and ERA2 empty bottle. <mark style="color:green;">LaNd</mark> is an NFT which will have one attribute - endless cold water spring. Owning the <mark style="color:blue;">LaNd</mark> there will be the possibility to pour a SPRING token to the ERA2 empty bottle. Filled bottles could be sold/traded/burned in <mark style="color:blue;">SPRING</mark> pool.

Later, Scent economy will include recipes and different bottles as NFT. Users will have a flexible way to create/burn/sell/buy any of NFT or token. In ERA3 <mark style="color:green;">LaNd</mark> map will be revealed, where <mark style="color:green;">LaNd</mark> owners will bet more ways to contribute to their earnings. Creativity is the key to a perfect Scent.

<mark style="color:blue;">SPRING</mark> token will be also used for acquiring fragrance/scent notes or refill bottle later, in ERA3
